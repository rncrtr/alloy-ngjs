        <h3>Giving</h3>
        <p>
            We give because of the grace that God has given us. The Bible describes this grace of giving as being:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
               <li>Generous (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A2&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>)</li>
                <li>Willful (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A3&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 8:3</a>)</li>
                <li>God-directed (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A5&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 8:5</a>)</li>
                <li>Shared (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A6&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>)</li>
                <li>Active (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A7&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>)</li>
                <li>Love-motivated (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A8&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 8:8</a>)</li> 
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        We are not under compulsion to give; rather, we should cheerfully offer what God has placed on our hearts (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor+9%3A7&version=NKJV" class="link
        ">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). We consider giving a form of worship to the Lord, which is why we receive these offerings during our Sunday service. We also offer an online giving option.
        </p>
        <p>
        You will never be asked for money at White Flag Calvary.  We trust in the Lord and not in our flesh.
