            Many families and school age children 
            in and around our neighborhood don't get enough to eat, 
            so this is a simple way to love our community in a tangible way.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ask for donations of these items to give away once a month:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Peanut Butter</li>
                <li>Jelly (Grape and other flavors)</li>
                <li>Pasta (Spaghetti and others)</li>
                <li>Pasta Sauce</li>
                <li>Cereal</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please come out and join us to give away food. We pray and talk with them about their lives. We'd love to have you join us.
